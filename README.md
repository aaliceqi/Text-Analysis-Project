# Text-Analysis-Project
 
Please read the [instructions](instructions.md).

1. Project Overview
For this project, I chose to use the Project Gutenburg data source to retrieve a plain text utf-8 file of Great Expectations by Charles Dickens because this is one of the most famous book in the American Curriculum. I also decided to use a book because I figured that I could apply what I have learned in the previous exercise on this and could be more creative with it. My main goal in this project is to see if the 10 most frequent words of a book can summarize a book's content. I want to remove common words and really only keep substance words in there. Some of these words include "to, and, a, etc." 

2. Implementation
